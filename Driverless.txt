"Driverless" Lyrics
did you speak you mind
did you choose your life
whatever are you talking about 
they always say no way no way
 
did you making your plan
did you feel a bit tired
are you ready to grow    
be your own master

(one) follow you arrow
(two) just be youself
(three) it's our time now
we are driverless

maybe we'll fall apart but it's not today
it's not today
maybe we'll die smiling but it's not today
it's not today
